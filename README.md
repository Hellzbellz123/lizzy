# Lystra

Lystra is a simple and small app that lets [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) display what is currently playing on Spotify. 

Simple examples of its output here:

Lystra listens to DBus signals emitted by Spotify. A signal will trigger Lystra to print the the currently playing artist and song to `/tmp/lystra_output.txt`. Lystra then sends a signal to let Waybar know it's time to update its output. 
The custom module in Waybar uses a simple `cat` command to read the contents of the file created by Lystra.

The main goal of this application is for me to explore and learn a bit of Rust, thus the code will be far from perfect. Feel free to give me feedback on it.

## Installation from source
1. Make sure you've got Rust installed. Either via your distributions package manager or [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/).
2. `cargo install --git https://github.com/stefur/lystra lystra`

## Configure Waybar
1. Add the following custom module to your Waybar config:
    ```
    "custom/spotify": {
        "interval": "once",
        "exec": "cat /tmp/lystra_output.txt"
        "signal": 8
    }
    ``` 
    Don't forget to add the module to your bar!

3. Run `lystra`, and preferably add `lystra` to whatever autostart method you're using.
4. Listen to music!

## Usage
Currently the following options can be used to customize the output of Lystra.

| Flag | Default value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--length` | 40 | Set the length of the string before truncating the text (and adds â€¦). |
| `--signal` | 8 | Set a custom signal number used to update Waybar. |
| `--playing` | "Playing: " | Set your own indicator for when a song is playing. |
| `--paused` | "Paused: " | Set your own indicator for when a song is paused. |
| `--separator` | " - " | Separator for *artist* and *title* in the output. |
| `--order` | "artist,title" | Comma-separated setting with the keywords *artist* and *title* to set a desired order of the output. |

## Todo
- Better and more examples of usage.
- Make a release(?)
