# Lystra

Lystra is a simple and small app that lets [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) display what is currently playing on Spotify. Lystra listens to DBus signals emitted by Spotify.

Simple examples of its output here:

## Configure Waybar
Add a custom module to your Waybar config:  
```

## Todo
- Better and more examples of usage.
- Make a release.
- Look into more interfaces (media players)
- Consider combining playing/paused args
