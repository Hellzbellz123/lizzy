# Lystra

Lystra is a simple and small app that lets [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) display what is currently playing on Spotify. Lystra listens to DBus signals emitted by Spotify.

Some examples of its output here:

## Installation from source
1. Make sure you've got Rust installed. Either via your distributions package manager or [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/).
2. `cargo install --git https://github.com/stefur/lystra lystra`

## Configure Waybar
Add a custom module to your Waybar config:  
```
"custom/spotify": {
    "exec": "cat /tmp/lystra-output",
    "interval": "once",
    "signal": 8
}
```  
Don't forget to add the module to your bar!

Then run `lystra`, and preferably add `lystra` to whatever autostart method you're using.

## Usage
Currently the following options can be used to customize the output of Lystra.

| Flag | Default value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--length` | 45 | Max length of the output before truncating (adds â€¦ to output). |
| `--signal` | 8 | Set a custom signal number used to update Waybar. |
| `--playing` | "Playing: " | Indicator used when a song is playing. |
| `--paused` | "Paused: " | Indicator used when a song is paused. |
| `--separator` | " - " | Separator between song artist and title. |
| `--order` | "artist,title" | The order of artist and title, comma-separated. |
| `--playbackcolor` | None | Text color for playback status. |
| `--textcolor` | None | Text color for artist and title. |

## Todo
- ~~Better and more examples of usage~~.
- ~~Make a release~~.
- Look into supporting more interfaces (media players).
- Feature: autopause/resume when other player begins playing.
